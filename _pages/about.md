I am an AI Researcher and Industry Professional with over 2 years of academic research and over 3 years of industry experience. I am currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at [the University of Texas at Dallas](https://engineering.utdallas.edu/), 
with an expected graduation in May 2026.

I am a Graduate Research Assistant at [Weill Cornell Medicine](https://weill.cornell.edu/), Cornell University, advised by [Dr. Amir H. Goldan](https://you.stonybrook.edu/goldan/), where I am researching Multimodal (Image and Time-series) Diffusion Models for Brain Activity and Medical Imaging.
At UTD, I work as a Graduate Research Assistant at the [Intelligent Robotics and Vision Lab](https://labs.utdallas.edu/irvl/), advised by [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/), focusing on intelligent long-horizon Robot Exploration. 
In addition, I was employed as a Teaching Assistant for CS3345 - Data Structures and Algorithms, under [Dr. Sridhar Alagar](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/sridhar) during Fall 2024 and Spring 2025 semesters.
My broader research interests lie in **Multimodal AI** and its intersection with **Robotics** and **Healthcare**.

This fall, I will be joining [Boehringer Ingelheim](https://www.boehringer-ingelheim.com/) as a Data Science (LLMs) Co-op.

Previously, I gained extensive industry experience at organizations like:

- [ISN](https://www.isnetworld.com/en/): Data Science (NLP) Summer Internship
- [Quantrium AI](https://www.quantrium.ai/) (Startup): ML Engineer for 2 years
- [Mirrag AI](https://mirrag.in/) (Startup): AI Engineer
- [Express Analytics](https://www.expressanalytics.com/): Data Science Internship

I earned my BTech in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Machine Learning from [Indian Institute of Technology Dharwad](https://www.iitdh.ac.in/). 
My [undergraduate thesis](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-05767-0_2) on a vision-based fruit assortment machine with optimal computation was published in Springer 2022.
