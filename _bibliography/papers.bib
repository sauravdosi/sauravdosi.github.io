abstract="In the Malnadu region of Karnataka state in India, often tender Areca nuts of five to eight months old are harvested together, manually separated according to ripeness based on their colour, dehusked, sliced and boiled before marketing. This is a tedious process involving skilled labour and due to the remnant pesticides on the arecanut surface, the health of the worker is adversely affected. Hence to aid the farmers, a technique is developed to carry the task of segregation based on Three Band Photometry and Machine Learning. Light green to fully ripe orange Areca nuts from two different regions were used for Training as well as Testing, using state-of-the-art YOLOv3 Object Detection Deep Neural Network model. They were studied at various stages after plucking between fresh from harvest to one week old. The method developed was found to be effective for both samples at any of these stages.",
